The LaTeX source files for these notes are available, but in the
corresponding folder for EMATM0067; EMATM0067 has a different exam but
it is covering the same material as part of a larger unit. This means
that unit has twice as many hours a week and the material is being
covered faster, so it is convenient to keep the source files there.
